## ðŸ“š Projects

### ðŸ§  Binary Classification with ANN and SMOTE
- **Context**: The goal of this project is to predict **customer churn** in a telecommunications company using structured data. The dataset includes demographic information, services used, and customer account history.
- **Description**: Predictive model using a fully connected ANN trained on imbalanced data, balanced using SMOTE.
- **Tech**: `Keras`, `SMOTE`, `RandomForest`, `scikit-learn`
- **Notebook**: [`CustomerChurn_BinaryClassification.ipynb`](./CustomerChurn/CustomerChurn_BinaryClassification.ipynb)
- **Dataset**: [`customer__churn.csv`](./Customer Churn.csv)

### ðŸ“· Image Classification with CNN (coming soon)
- **Description**: Convolutional Neural Network trained on image data for multiclass classification.
- **Tech**: `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `CNN`, `Matplotlib`
