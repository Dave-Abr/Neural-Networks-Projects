### üè® Booking Cancellation Prediction with Neural Networks
- **Description**: This project uses a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to predict whether a customer will cancel a hotel reservation.
- **Context**: Builds a classification model using artificial neural networks to analyze hotel booking data. Applies hyperparameter tuning (number of hidden layers, neurons, activation functions) and Dropout regularization to improve performance.
- **Tech**: `Python`,`Pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow `, `Keras`
- **Notebook**: [`BookCancellation_ANN.ipynb`](notebooks/BookCancellation_ANN.ipynb)
- **Dataset**: [`hotel_bookings.csv`](data/hotel_bookings.csv)

### üìµ Binary Classification with ANN and SMOTE
- **Description**: Predictive model using a fully connected ANN trained on imbalanced data, balanced using SMOTE.
- **Context**: The goal of this project is to predict **customer churn** in a telecommunications company using structured data. The dataset includes demographic information, services used, and customer account history.
- **Tech**: `Keras`, `SMOTE`, `RandomForest`, `scikit-learn`
- **Notebook**: [`CustomerChurn_BinaryClassification.ipynb`](notebooks/CustomerChurn_BinaryClassification.ipynb)
- **Dataset**: [`CustomerChurn.csv`](data/CustomerChurn.csv)
